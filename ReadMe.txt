You are lost on a campus never before seen.  
You may navigate by typing 'n' or 'north', 's' or 'south', 'e' or 'east', or 'w' or 'west'
to move from place to place.  I am sure there is a way to purchase a map to help you!

Using 'm' or 'map' will open a map, if bought, using 'q' or 'quit' will exit the program,
and using 'h' or 'help' will display possible commands.

In order to add items to inventory, you may find the items at the shop.  Currency will be
implemented in versions to come.  You may also find items on the ground and use 't' or 'take'
to add them to your inventory! Type 'i' to view your inventory.
